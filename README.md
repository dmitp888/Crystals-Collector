# Crystals-Collector
This is a fun and interactive web browser game that utilizes HTML and jQuery. The app dynamically updates  HTML pages with the jQuery library.

Here's how the app works:

   * Four crystals are displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player is shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it  adds a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * The game  hides this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     * When they do click one,  the player's score counter gets updated.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

     * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.

##### Game design notes

* The random number shown at the start of the game is between 19 - 120.

* Each crystal has a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
